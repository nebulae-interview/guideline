# Interview Guidelines

This GitHub organization and its repositories are intended for people wanting to become part of Nebula Engineering development team.  
NebulaE solutions are based on our own MicroService Framework.  The main difference or advantage of our framework is that we have achieved truly fullstack microservice, each microservice is totally independent and its repo contains the whole stack in it: FronEnd, API, Backend, Persistance + IT Deployment. 

The idea is that you can run the interview test within the framework itself, to do so we are going to give you some guidelines to understand a little bit about the microservice framework and as well the guideline for the test itself.  

If you have some inquiry please write to: sebastian.molano@nebulae.com.co

Thanks in Advance, hope you have fun!
